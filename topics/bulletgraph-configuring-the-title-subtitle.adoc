== Configuring the Title/Subtitle

[[_Ref363400467]]

=== Title/subtitle configuration summary

The title of a  _{BulletGraphName}_   control is typically used to identify what is being measured with it, i.e., its primary measure. The subtitle allows for providing additional details when this is deemed necessary. The title/subtitle are positioned inside the Title area of the control.

The Title area is the area in which the title/subtitle of the bullet graph is displayed. This area cannot overlap the scale (i.e. the Graph area).

Not set by default, when the bullet graph is oriented horizontally, the Title area configures its width automatically to fit the title and/or subtitle (whichever is longer). In addition to that, you can set the width of the Title area explicitly, a capability which comes handy when you have several  _{BulletGraphName}_   controls placed on top of each other and you want their Title areas to have the same widths for a well-aligned look-and-feel.

For setting an explicit width of the Title area, the link:{BulletGraphLink}.{BulletGraphName}{ApiProp}titleshorizontalratio.html[TitlesHorizontalRatio] property is used.

image::images/BulletGraph_Configuring_the_Title_Subtitle_1.png[]

Note that the Title area and the Graph area can be configured with swapped positions (i.e. the Graph area on the left and the Title area on the right at horizontal orientation): in this case, the Title area starts at the end of the scale so the Graph area begins at the edge of the control and ends where the Title area begins. The positions of the Graph area and the Title area are swapped with the link:{BulletGraphLink}.{BulletGraphName}{ApiProp}titlesposition.html[TitlesPosition] property.

.Note
[NOTE]
====
When the positions of the Graph area and the Title area are swapped in vertical orientation (the Graph area is above the Title area), then the title and the subtitle, too, swap their positions – the subtitle appears above the title.
====

Styles can be applied to the title/subtitle which allows for customizing their outer look.
